Fake currency detection is a critical application of machine learning and computer vision in the field of financial security. 
This project aims to identify counterfeit banknotes using image processing techniques and machine learning/deep learning models.
The system can analyze features such as:
 ---> Texture
 ---> Color patterns
 ---> Security marks
 ---> Serial numbers
and classify whether a note is genuine or fake.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
  ---> OpenCV (Image Processing)
  ---> NumPy, Pandas (Data Handling)
  ---> Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)
  ---> Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
  ---> TensorFlow / PyTorch (Deep Learning, if used)
